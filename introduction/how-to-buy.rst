Rupaya can be purchased and sold on a variety of exchanges.

- :ref:`Exchanges <exchanges>` are one of the most popular ways to trade
  cryptocurrency. A wide range of exchanges exist, each offering 
  slightly different features. Some serve different markets, some are in
  direct competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to
  more or less strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are 
  centralized, meaning they are operated by a single company, which may
  be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates to 
  collect data on its customers. Others are decentralized, but as a 
  result have higher escrow requirements since you are dealing 
  peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be 
  broadly broken down into two categories: exchanges which accept 
  national currency (fiat money) and exchanges which deal in 
  cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges should not be used as 
  wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings.

Exchanges
=========

Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known as fiat money, into cryptocurrency. Many exchanges do not accept fiat money, and exchange between various cryptocurrencies only. Trades are
handled on markets, and trades are created between pairs of currencies, identified by their ticker codes. The volume traded on an exchange provides a good indication of how quickly a buy or sell order you place will be filled. This section introduces some of the most popular exchanges for trading Rupaya.
