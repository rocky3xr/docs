The Rupaya platform will encompass three main pillars in order to effectively solve the key payment and transaction challenges facing South Asia.

* Owning Part of the Future (Governance Voting, Staking akin to interest) 
* Improving the Payment Experience (method of payment for goods and services)
* Reducing Currency Transfer Fees
   
The South Asia region faces several unique challenges which hinder access to even the most basic banking and payment solutions. Issues such as regular electricity outages and a unreliable or nonexistent internet access impose severe limitations on traditional banking, as well as the use of many Western cryptocurrencies for remittance and payment processing. The region also faces onerously high currency transfer fees. Our solution to allowing payments in the face of poor electricity and internet connectivity centers on providing an excellent mobile wallet experience that is secure and robust. Further, we will research, develop, and deploy smart Point of Sale systems designed for e-commerce and brick & mortar businesses. These Point of Sale systems will leverage SwiftTX technology, already present in Rupaya, for instant transactions and a fast and seamless customer experience. To solve the extremely high transfer currency fees within the South Asia region we propose the creation of a dedicated RUPX/Fiat currency exchange. The cost of sending Rupaya is exponentially lower than sending traditional fiat currency. A low cost RUPX/Fiat currency exchange will enable the region to keep more of its money. Together the Rupaya solutions will empower people in South Asia and provide an increased opportunity for regional economic growth and vitality.

If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to
understand is that transactions occur directly between two parties
without any central authority to facilitate the transaction. This also
means that you are responsible for your own security - there is no bank
or credit card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen
or lost. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but
cryptocurrency can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease,
if you are confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For
these reasons, the Rupaya documentation has a strong focus on safety and
understanding the concepts and features that drive the Rupaya ecosystem.
