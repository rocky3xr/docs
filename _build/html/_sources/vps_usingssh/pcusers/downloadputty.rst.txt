These instructions are intended for PC users that will be using Putty and SSH keys to login to the Linux VPS.  If you already have Putty installed and are able to connect to the Linux VPS using an SSH key then you can skip this process and proceed to the next section to :ref:`disable password logins and root login access<disablepasswordlogins>`.

Configure Putty to use an SSH Key
---------------------------------

1. Follow these steps to add the SSH key into the **rupx01** Putty session.

	* Click on the saved session named **rupx01** and click **Load** 
	* Expand the **SSH** Category on the left side of the window
	* Click on the **Auth** Category so that it is highlighted
	* Click on **Browse** on the right, under to the field **Private key file for authentication**
	* Browse to the folder that contains your SSH private key
	* Select the **sshprivatekey.ppk** file and click **Open**
	* Scroll back up on the left under **Category** and click on the word **Session**, at the top of the window, to bring back the **Saved Sessions** page
	* Click on **Save** to save the SSH Key to the **rupx01** session.  
	* **NOTE: This step is very important.  Make sure that your server rupx01 is loaded in the Saved Sessions window and that you click Save.  If this step is not completed successfully, then your SSH Key will not be saved to this session and you will have to repeat these steps again**

.. _connectwithputty_downloadputty:

2. In the Putty window, click **Open** to connect to your Linux VPS.

	* Click Yes on the PuTTY Security Alert to install the security certificate

.. _loginasroot_downloadputty:

3. 	Login as the **root** user and type in, or paste in, your **root** password.

	* **The screen will not display your password**
	* **NOTE:** For those using Digital Ocean as your VPS provider, you will be prompted to change your **root** password.

.. _changetosshdir_downloadputty:

Configure the Linux VPS to use an SSH Key
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should be logged into the Linux VPS as the **root** user to complete the following steps:

1. Change directory into the /root/.ssh directory or create it if necessary::

	cd /root/.ssh

* NOTE: If the directory does not already exist then use this command to create it::

	mkdir /root/.ssh

.. _editauthorizedkeys_downloadputty:

2. Create and edit the file named authorized_keys with the following command::

	nano /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

.. _pastesshkey_downloadputty:

3. Paste the SSH public key into the **authorized_keys** file on the Linux VPS.  This is the public key that you generated and then copied from the PuttyGen application.

	* **CRITICAL NOTE:** The SSH key that you paste in should begin with the text **ssh-rsa** and should end with a date, such as **rsa-key-20181012**.  If you do not get the entire key pasted into this file then the following steps will fail and you will have to repeat these steps.

4. Save and close the file by hitting **Ctrl-X**, and then type **Y** to confirm that you want to save it, and then hit **ENTER** to confirm the file name.
	
	* NOTE: Your new SSH key is now saved in the **/root/.ssh/authorized_keys** file.  All future logins with the root username will allow you to login without being prompted for a password.

.. _loginwithoutpass_downloadputty:

**Let's test it!**
	
5. Duplicate the current Putty session and login as the **root** user.  This will verify that you can now login to the Linux VPS without entering a password.  

	* To duplicate the existing Putty session to the Linux VPS, click the icon of two computers on the top left of the Putty application window and then select **Duplicate Session** 
	* **NOTE: You should be automatically logged in to the Linux VPS without having to type in the root password**
	
.. warning::  If you are not automatically logged in without typing in a password then you likely did not save the SSH key into the putty session correctly, or you did not save the entire SSH key into the Linxu VPS file /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.  You will need to walk through the steps to save the SSH key in the Putty session and to ensure that the ENTIRE SSH key is added to the authorized_keys file on the Linux VPS before you proceed with the next section.
	
**If you are able to use Putty to login to the Linux VPS without being prompted for a password then you are done configuring your SSH keys and can proceed to the next section to disable password logins and root login access.**

**For those of you that were already in the middle of the MasterNode setup process, you can return to the** :ref:`Finishing Touches section to configure the user rupxmn to use SSH keys<configuringssh_finishingtouches>`.
