**Introduction**
   
Masternodes are servers with a pre-determined amount of collateral backing their power to validate transactions on the network.  Features of the masternode network include anonymous and instant transactions, as well as governance of the development of the Rupaya network through a monthly budget and voting. This in itself is a first in the crypto world, and the masternodes are necessary to achieve the privacy and speed that Rupaya offers. In terms of Rupaya, the amount required to run a masternode is 20000 RUPX.  **YOU NEED TO BUY 20001 IN ORDER TO COVER TRANSACTION FEES FROM THE EXCHANGE TO YOUR WALLET** (Transfer fee from stocks exchange is .001 for example).  In exchange for this investment your server running the Rupaya core wallet is enabled to validate transactions on the blockchain.  For this validation service that your server is providing, you are rewarded in two ways.  The most straightforward way is in the case of Masternode Rewards (set amount of currency).  The second is through the governance system.  Proposals are submitted and only Masternode owners may vote on those proposals and thereby you help to control the growth and development of your investment.

This documentation is concentrated on providing a strong understanding of the services that masternodes provide to the network, but also how to to setup your masternode via either a hosted service provider or maintaining your own server.

**Option 1: Hosted masternode**

Running a masternode on your own does require an intermediate understanding of blockchains and server configuration, and while we do provide guides and tools to make this as easy as possible, we understand that many may still prefer to have someone take care of all the setup and maitenance.  Several members of the blockchain community have emerged to provide dedicated hosting solutions for a fee.  No technical experience is required as you need only provide them with payment for the collateral and hosting services to receive the block rewards.

**Option 2: Self-operated masternode**

Users with the required skills or the desire to learn more about the inner workings of the Rupaya network may choose to run their own MasterNode on the host server of their choosing.  There are several steps involved in this process and the user assumes the responsibility to set up, configure, maintain, and secure your masternode collateral.  The following pages will get you started on your journey to understanding the masternode role and setting up your first masternode.
